<a href="#link1"><h5>You begin to think, maybe erroneously,<br>that this other kind of anger is really a<br>
    type of knowledge: the type that both<br>
    clarifies and disappoints. It responds to<br>
    insult and attempted erasure simply by<br>
    asserting presence, and the energy required<br>
    to present, to react, to assert is accompanied<br>
    by visceral disappointment: a disappointment<br>
    in the sense that no amount of visibility<br>
    will alter the ways in which one is perceived.</p></h5></a>
